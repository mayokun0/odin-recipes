   <h2>Cooked Lasagna</h2>
   <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</p>
    
    <p>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</p>
    
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</p>
